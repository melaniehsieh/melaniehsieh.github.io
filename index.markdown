Current intellectual curiousity (*last update Oct 2024*):

I'm currently drafting a research paper for RAND on Chinaâ€™s High Performance Computers (HPC) infrastructure. Previously, I interned at DoS, researching China's S&T talent pipeline and participated in [Track II dialogue](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melaniehsieh_uschinarelations-bilateralrelations-taiwan-activity-7098093507575238656-erx_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) in D.C. on enhancing US-China bilateral relationship.

I skipped the last year of high school in Hong Kong to study Physics in the US. In the summer of 2024, I cycled 4,500 miles from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska over 70 days to raise funds and awareness for cancer research and support services.

I enjoy [reading](/book), [writing](/essay), hiking, and long walks.
