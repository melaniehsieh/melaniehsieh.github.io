# Melanie Hsieh
Studying Physics, [Political Philosophy](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/), and [WWII](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/normandy-scholar-program-on-wwii/) at UT Austin. [Don Lavoie Fellow](https://www.mercatus.org/students/don-lavoie-fellowship) at the Mercatus Center, George Mason University.

Current intellectual curiousity (*last update Oct 2024*):
- Decentralized institutions (DeSci)
- Montesquieu, commercial republic
- Faulkner, *The Sound and the Fury*
- Wong Kar-wai movies

I'm currently researching [China’s High Performance Computers (HPC) infrastructure](https://www.csis.org/analysis/silicon-valley-should-carefully-assess-its-ai-and-semiconductor-dealings-middle-east). Previously, I interned at DoS, researching China's S&T talent pipeline and participated in [Track II dialogue](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melaniehsieh_uschinarelations-bilateralrelations-taiwan-activity-7098093507575238656-erx_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) in D.C. on enhancing US-China bilateral relationship.

I skipped the last year of high school in Hong Kong to study Physics in the US. In the summer of 2024, I cycled 4,500 miles from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska over 70 days to raise funds and awareness for cancer research and support services.

I enjoy [reading](/book), [writing](/essay), hiking, and long walks.
